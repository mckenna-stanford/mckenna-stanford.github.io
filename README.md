# About Me

I am an atmospheric and climate scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. My work focuses on using high-quality remote sensing and in situ observational platforms to improve cloud process representation in numerical weather prediction and climate models across a range of spatiotemporal scales spanning those of an individual ice crystal up to the climate system. Specific research foci include cloud microphysics, deep convective processes, physics parameterization development, and aerosol-cloud interactions.
